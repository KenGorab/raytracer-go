# Todo

This project began as a way to learn more about ray tracing/computer graphics, and there are (obviously) a number of
things that could (and should) be done to improve it. Some improvements are, in no particular order:

  - Providing an output path for generated image
    - Should this be in the scene config, or maybe as a flag/argument?
  - Other image formats (only supports [PPM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netpbm_format) images for now)
    - PNG, JPEG, others?
  - It's pretty slow, and gets slower as the rendering goes on. There are surely ways of improving the speed
  - Adding other shapes/materials! I think a plane would be easy to implement.
  - Anything else? I'm sure I'll add more to this list
